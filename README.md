# Machine_Learning_Projects

This is an implementation of Linear regression.This is a multiple linear regression in which the output variable is mapped with all the features or all the input variable.

This uses LinearRegression class which belongs to the linear_model module of scikit learn library of python.

Dataset is taken from boston housing which is downloaded by class load_Boston of datasets module of scikit learn library of python.

Model is fitted with X_train and Y_train data.

Performance of the model is checked with both training as well as testing data.

3 types of Error is calculated.1) Root Mean Square Error 2) Mean Absolute error 3) Mean Sqaure Error for bothe testing as well as training data. For this purpose metrics class of scikit-learn module is used.

Pandas is used to create the data and read file.
